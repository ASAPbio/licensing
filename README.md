# ASAPbio Preprint Licensing Survey

This repository is home to the data and analyses produced by ASAPbio's 2018 [preprint licensing survey](http://asapbio.org/licensing-survey).
This survey was created by ASAPbio's [licensing task force](http://asapbio.org/licensing).
The survey was conducted via [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCulXporVje3r73PKPa7kI4zJ9_s5z-9qa5W8gNamODSBDfQ/closedform) and was open from 2018-02-15 to 2018-03-05.
It was announced on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ASAPbio_/status/964302697657708544) as well as via the [ASAPbio newsletter](http://asapbio.org/asapbio-newsletter-vol-12) and was open to the public.

## Files

The unmodified Google Forms output is available in [`data/survey-responses-raw.csv`](data/survey-responses-raw.csv).
This data is also available as a spreadsheet in [`data/survey-responses.xlsx`](data/survey-responses.xlsx), which splits out the responses from individuals who have not posted a preprint before.

See [`slides/survey-summary.pptx`](slides/survey-summary.pptx) for preliminary analyses and visualization of the survey responses.
Further analysis and contributions are welcome.
